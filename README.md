# Doorbell
A Slack bot used by Armada Robotics to notify when people need to be let in. <br>
When passed the `-l` argument the program should be run with the `-u` flag so that stdout and stderr are immediately flushed to the log file. <br>
Running with logging to a file:
```python
python -u src/main.py -l
```
